# bioRxiv-LaTeX-template

This is a **LaTeX** template for scientific publications (e.g. on BioRxiv) that contains several examples of how to embed figures directly into the manuscript.

To use download template.tex and change to your needs. Additional files (figure PDFs + libraby.bib) are only necessary to compile complete PDF.

You can run your own LaTeX compiler or use online services (e.g. [Overleaf](www.overleaf.com)).
